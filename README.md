## Introduction

This project aims to detect roads in satellite images using a deep learning approach. The model used for this task is DeepLabV3 with a ResNet-50 backbone, a popular architecture for semantic segmentation tasks. The model has been trained to identify road areas in images and generate corresponding binary masks.

## Model Overview

### DeepLabV3

DeepLabV3 is a state-of-the-art semantic segmentation model developed by Google. It employs atrous convolution (also known as dilated convolution) to capture multi-scale context and improve the accuracy of segmentation tasks. The backbone of the model used here is ResNet-50, which provides a good trade-off between performance and computational efficiency.

- **Architecture**: DeepLabV3 with ResNet-50 backbone
- **Purpose**: Semantic segmentation for road detection
- **Pre-trained Weights**: Initially trained on a larger dataset, then fine-tuned on the specific road detection dataset

### Why DeepLabV3?

1. **State-of-the-Art Performance**: DeepLabV3 consistently performs well on benchmark segmentation tasks.
2. **Atrous Convolution**: This allows for effective multi-scale feature extraction without losing spatial resolution.
3. **Flexibility**: The model can be easily adapted for various segmentation tasks by fine-tuning on specific datasets.
